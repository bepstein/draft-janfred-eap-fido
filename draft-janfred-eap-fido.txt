1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] is a widely
   used standard that allows a server to authenticate a client using
   different authentication methods.  There is a huge variety of EAP
   methods available, that serve different purposes and have different
   security implications.

   Two common EAP methods are EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS [RFC5281], that both
   use EAP-TLS [RFC5216] to provide confidentiality of the inner
   authentication.  This inner authentication is most commonly password-
   based, meaning that an attacker that manages to compromise the TLS
   connection can eavesdrop on the authentication and observe the
   password.  The authentication of the server to the client within the
   TLS handshake thus is a vital security function of these EAP methods.

   The operational praxis has shown that this is a common problem and
   security flaw.  The specification for EAP-TLS [RFC5216] does not
   include guidance on how to decide if a certificate is valid for this
   specific authentication.  This standardization gap has lead to user
   interfaces, where the default setting for certificate validation was
   set to "Do not validate".  Even if the validation is active, the
   supplicant has no implicit information to determine the expected
   subject name in the server's certificate, so users need to manually
   configure the expected domain.  Failure to configure this or not
   configuring it at all could again lead to an attacker being able to
   compromise the TLS connection and, as a result, also the password
   sent in the inner authentication.

   There are two major security problems here, that this specification
   wants to address.  Firstly, the use of passwords as authentication
   method implies that the password needs to be sent to the server.  If
   an attacker observes this exchange, they can impersonate the user at
   any time.  Therefore, this specification uses FIDO authentication,
   which is based on asymmetric cryptography.  With this method, even if
   an attacker is able to compromise the TLS connection, they cannot
   impersonate the user based on the observed data.

   The second major security problem is the specification gap regarding
   certificate validation.  With EAP-FIDO, the supplicants now have a
   clear specification on how to decide wether or not a server
   certificate is considered valid for the current authentication flow.
   This is achieved by using the trust anchors available on most devices
   and a method to determine the valid server name based on implicit
   information of the authentication configuration.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview over the EAP-FIDO protocol

   The EAP-FIDO protocol comprises two phases: the TLS handshake phase
   and FIDO-exchange phase.

   During the TLS handshake phase, TLS is used to authenticate the EAP-
   FIDO server to the client.

   During the FIDO-exchange phase, the actual FIDO authentication is
   executed and the client authenticates itself to the server.

   Once the FIDO exchange is completed successfully, the client and
   server can derive keying material from the TLS handshake phase
   implicitly.

3.1.  TLS handshake phase

   During the TLS handshake phase, the client and server establish a TLS
   tunnel.  This is done using EAP-TLS [RFC5216], [RFC9190], [RFC9427]
   with the modifications described in TODO:SECTION LINK.  As part of
   the TLS handshake protocol, the EAP-FIDO server will send its
   certificate along with a chain of certificates leading to the
   certificate of a trusted CA.  The client will check this certificate
   using the rules in TODO:SECTION LINK.

   Once the TLS tunnel is established, the client and server proceed to
   the FIDO-exchange phase to perform the authentication of the client.

3.2.  FIDO-exchange phase

   In this phase, the TLS record layer is used to securily tunnel
   information between the EAP-FIDO client and EAP-FIDO server.

   For the FIDO-exchange phase, the client has two options, depending on
   the configuration and the capability of the FIDO token.

   If the FIDO token supports residential keys and EAP-FIDO is
   configured to use these for authentication, the client generates a
   challenge from the TLS keying material and triggers a FIDO challenge.

   If the client is not configured to use residential keys, the client
   first needs to send its username to the server.  The server will
   answer with a list of FIDO key IDs and the client will attempt to use
   one of these keys to authenticate.

4.  EAP-FIDO protocol flow and message format

   This section describes the preconditions and the configuration needed
   for EAP-FIDO, the protocol flow and the message format

4.1.  Preconditions and Configuration

   In order to successfully perform an EAP-FIDO authentication, the
   server and the client have to meet some preconditions and need to
   have a configuration.

   EAP-FIDO assumes that the FIOD authenticator is already registered
   with the server, that is, the EAP-FIDO server has access to the
   public key used to verify the authenticator's response as well as the
   corresponding credential id.

   On the client side, the supplicant must be configured with the
   Relying Party ID (see Appendix A.1, and, if Passkeys are not used,
   with a Username.

4.2.  TLS handshake phase

   The packet format for EAP-FIDO messages follows the format specified
   in [RFC5216], Section 3 with the following modifications:

   *  The Type field is set to TODO [awaiting IANA early allocation]
      (EAP-FIDO)

   *  Within the Flags field, the Version bits are set to the major
      version of EAP-FIDO.  For this specification, the version is 0.
      Future EAP-FIDO versions MAY increase the version number.

4.2.1.  EAP-FIDO Start packet

   In the first packet from the server to the client, the S-bit of the
   Flags MUST be set, indicating the start of the EAP-FIDO protocol.  It
   MUST NOT be set in any subsequent packet.


   // Depending on the decision on the way, the RPID is determined, some
   // additional spec may be added here, see Appendix A.1.
   //
   // -- Janfred

4.2.2.  Version negotiation

   The version of EAP-FIDO is negotiated in the first exchange between
   server and client.  The server sets the highest major version number
   of EAP-FIDO that it supports in the V field of the flags in its Start
   message.  In the case of this specification, this is 0.  In its first
   EAP message in response, the client sets the V field to the highest
   major version number that it supports that is no higher than the
   version number offered by the server.  If the client version is not
   acceptable to the server, it sends an EAP-Failure to terminate the
   EAP session.  Otherwise, the version set by the client is the version
   of EAP-FIDO that MUST be used and both server and client MUST set the
   V field to that version number in all subsequent EAP messages.

   Given the limited range of the V field (values 0-7), future EAP-FIDO
   versions MUST NOT increase the major version if there are no changes
   to the outer message format.  Minor version updates that only affect
   the inner protocol flow MUST be done with means available during the
   TLS handshake, i.e. using Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
   (ALPN).

4.2.3.  Fragmentation

   Each EAP-FIDO message contains a single leg of a half-duplex
   conversation.  Since EAP carrier protocols may constrain the length
   of an EAP message, it may be neccessary to fragment an EAP-FIDO
   message across multiple EAP messages.

   The fragmentation method is described in [RFC5216], Section 2.1.5.

4.2.4.  TLS Handshake Requirements

   The client and server perform a TLS handshake following the
   specification in [RFC5216], Section 2 and [RFC9190], Section 2 with
   the following modifications:

   *  TLS version 1.3 or higher MUST be negotiated.

   *  Mutual authentication is not required.  Implementations MUST
      support EAP-FIDO without TLS client authentication, but MAY allow
      it, i.e. if EAP-FIDO is used as a 2-Factor authentication method
      where TLS client certificates are the first factor and the FIDO
      authentication is the second.

   *  The certificate of the server MUST be validated.  The different
      options for validation are listed in Section 4.2.5.

   *  (FIXME, depending on RPID option) The client MUST send the desired
      Relying Party ID for the FIDO exchange in the Server Name
      Indication extension.

4.2.5.  TLS Server Certificate Verification

   (FIXME: Currently only bulletpoints, will be converted into text) *
   Clients MUST support validating against a built-in list of Root CAs,
   ideally WebPKI. * Implementations MAY support pinning a trust anchor
   * The RPID MUST be validated against the certificate name (How
   exactly is still TODO) * TODO: OCSP Stapling?  Mandatory or not?

4.3.  FIDO-exchange

   After the TLS handshake is completed, the client and server perform
   the FIDO-exchange to authenticate the client inside the TLS tunnel.

   The server sends an authentication request to the client.  The client
   then decides if it has sufficient information to perform the FIDO
   authentication.  If this is case, the client responds with an
   authenication response which includes the FIDO response.  If the
   client needs additional information, i.e. because it does not use
   Passkeys and therefore needs a list of Key Identifiers, the client
   sends an information request to the server, which may include
   additional information from client to help the server to fulfil the
   information request, i.e. the inner username.  If the server receives
   such an information request it responds with the additional
   information.  The client answers then with an authentication
   response.

   Depending on the result of the FIDO authentication, the server MAY
   choose to trigger a second FIDO authentication with a new
   authentication request packet.

   *  Server sends initial data

      -  RPID?

      -  Auth request level (Silent, up, uv)

      -  Additional Client-Data

   *  Choice: Passkey or not?

      -  When Passkey: GOTO "Client sends response"

   *  Client sends Username

   *  Server sends Key-List

   *  Client sends response

   *  Choice: Result

      -  When Successful and sufficient:

         o  Protected Success Indicator

      -  When Successful and not sufficient:

         o  Server sends signature request again with more information

      -  When not Successful:

         o  Protected Failure Indicator

4.3.1.  Message format

   All EAP-FIDO messages in the inner authentication consist of a CBOR
   sequence with two elements:

   type:  integer to indicate the message type.  Table 1 contains a list
      of the different message types.

   attributes:  a CBOR encoded map with attributes.  A list of the
      different attributes, their assigned mapkey and the type are
      listed in Table 2.

5.  Implementation Guidelines

6.  Design decisions

   This section documents several design decisions for the EAP-FIDO
   protocol

6.1.  Registration of FIDO2 keys is out of scope

   The FIDO CTAP2 protocol has distinct primitives for the registration
   and the usage of a FIDO2 credential.  This specification requires
   that the registratrion of the security token has been done out-of-
   band, for example using the WebAuthn protocol in a browser context.

   There are multiple degrees of freedom when registering a token with
   CTAP2.  This specification recognises the following choices at
   registration time, and defines how to effectuate an authentication
   transaction for any combination of these choices.

6.1.1.  Discoverable credentials vs. Non-Discoverable credentials

   FIDO2 tokens contain a master key which never leaves the security
   perimeter of the token exists on the device.  FIDO2 tokens transact
   by generating asymetric keypairs which are bound to a scope (often: a
   domain name, a RADIUS realm).  The scoped keying material is saved in
   either of two locations:

   *  Non-Discoverable Credentials: All the keying material is stored on
      the server-side.  The private key is encrypted with the token-
      specific master key so that the server can store, but not use, the
      device's private key.  During authentication transactions, the
      keying material is sent to the token for local decryption and
      usage.  The security token itself does not store any data
      persistently; it is stateless and thus the number of keypairs and
      scopes it manages is infinite.

   *  Discoverable Credentials: The keying material is stored on the
      security token itself, along with the scope for which the keypair
      was generated.  During authentication transactions, only the scope
      (as configured, or as sent by the server) determines which keypair
      is to be used in the transaction.  The key can store multiple keys
      for the same scope.  The number of keypairs that can be stored on
      the key is finite.

   EAP-FIDO supports both Discoverable and Non-Discoverable credentials.

6.1.2.  User involvement during registration

   Token registration can involve one of two levels of asserting the
   user presence.

   *  UP (userPresence): the registration ceremony ensures that a person
      is present at the token while registering the device (e.g. human
      tissue needs to touch a physical security key while the
      registration transaction executes).

   *  UV (userVerification): the security token registers a unique
      property of the user during the registration ceremony, such that
      it is asserted that only the exact same person can interact with
      the token in the future (e.g. by registering a fingerprint or
      facial recognition)

   During authentication transactions, an EAP-FIDO server can request
   one of three levels of asserting user presence.

   *  Silent (interaction with a human is not required)

   *  UP (physical interaction with a person is required)

   *  UV (physical interaction with the registered user is required).

   An authentication transaction can not request a higher level than was
   set at registration time; i.e. a token registered in UP mode can not
   transact in UV mode.

   EAP-FIDO supports all three transaction modes, and the server can
   signal its required minimum assertion level for each individual
   authentication transaction.

6.2.  FIDO2 key scopes

   The scope of a FIDO2 key as set during the registration transaction
   determines the contexts in which it can be used.  In EAP-FIDO, the
   following three notions interplay:

   *  the realm of username as used in the EAP-Identity exchange ("outer
      ID")

   *  the servername as presented during the EAP-TLS exchange by the
      EAP-FIDO server

   *  the relyingPartyIdentifier (rpId) that is used during the FIDO
      CTAP2 client authentication phase

   EAP-FIDO requires the registered scope to be:

   *  identical to the realm in the outer ID

   *  within the same second-level domain as the EAP-TLS server
      certificate will be

   *  within the same second-level domain as the FIDO rpId

6.3.  EAP-Method with EAP-TLS vs standalone EAP method to be used in
      tunnels

   Since there already exist EAP methods that provide a TLS tunnel and
   are capable of encapsulating further EAP methods, e.g.  EAP-PEAP or
   EAP-TTLS, the question arises, why this specification does not focus
   solely on the FIDO exchange as a standalone EAP method instead of re-
   specifying a new EAP-method that again makes use of EAP-TLS.

   The main reason for a decision against this is the potential for
   misconfiguration.  One of the goals for this EAP method is to provide
   a means to validate the server certificate using implicit
   configuration options.  Using EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP would counteract
   this goal, since in most supplicants the configuration for the
   different phases of the tunneled TLS methods is done seperately, so
   the users would have to configure the certificate check parameters
   manually again.  Additionally, not every supplicant application
   allows access to information about the phase 1 exchange, namely the
   server certificate parameters, which is neccessary for the security
   of the EAP-FIDO exchange.  Specifying EAP-FIDO as standalone EAP
   methods would therefore require modifying the EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP
   stack.  Implementers might be tempted to re-use the insecure and
   error-prone configuration interfaces.  To prevent this from the
   start, EAP-FIDO specifies an EAP-TLS based EAP method that cannot be
   used standalone.

   Although this requires protentially duplicate code for supplicants
   that support multiple EAP-TLS based methods, the authors believe this
   means of specification to be more resistant against implementation
   errors and prevent error-prone user interfaces.

Appendix A.  Open Questions regarding Protocol design

   Note to RFC Editor: Remove this section before publication.

   Since this specification is an early draft, there are a lot of open
   questions that we want to get community feedback on.

A.1.  How to determine the FIDO Relying Party ID?

   FIDO needs a relying party ID to function.  The question is how this
   RPID is determined, there are several options that all have pros and
   cons.

A.1.1.  Option 1: Configuration

   The first option would be to just have the RPID as a configuration
   item, maybe with a default on the realm of the outer username.
   Adding a configuration option complicates the setup of the EAP
   method, but hopefully not too much.  A misconfiguration of the RPID
   is also not that critical from a security standpoint.  The effects of
   a misconfigured RPID are only a problem if the used FIDO key is also
   registered with a third party, in which case the third party could
   trick the client to connect to a bogous network.

   If the RPID deviates from the realm, the client could send the
   requested RPID using Server Name Indication.

A.1.2.  Option 2: Mandate RPID to equal Realm of the Username

   The second option would be to mandate that the RPID is equal to the
   realm portion of the username.  This restricts options on how to use
   EAP-FIDO and may cause unnecessary difficulties in routing, if the
   convinient routing domain (e.g. the registered domain for a company)
   should not be used as RPID due to security concerns, or different
   RPIDs should be used under the same routing realm.

A.1.3.  Option 3: RPID is determined by the server and sent before the
        TLS handshake

   Since the RPID plays an important role in the decision whether or not
   the certificate sent by the server is to be trusted, the RPID should
   be determined before the TLS handshake.  The server could determine
   the RPID based on the outer username and send it as payload in the
   EAP-TLS Start packet.  This way, the client has a clear indication as
   to whether or not to trust the server certificate sent in the
   subsequent TLS handshake.

   However, this opens up some security issues that are yet to be
   investigated, since the RPID could be modified by an on-path
   attacker.

A.1.4.  Option 4: RPID is determined by the server and sent after the
        TLS handshake

   WIth this option, the problem is that the client needs to cache the
   server certificate in order to determine if the RPID is valid. for
   the given certificate, unless the rules for certificate verification
   and RPID determination specify it otherwise.  One possibility to
   circumvent this would be to allow the server certificate names and
   the RPID to deviate, but validate both against the realm of the outer
   username, e.g. a realm of example.com with a server certificate for
   radius.example.com and the FIDO RPID fido.example.com.

   This, however, adds a whole lot more of security concerns, especially
   in environments with different independent devisions under the same
   domain suffix.
